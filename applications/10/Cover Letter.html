            <!-- Greetings -->
            <h6 class="text-primary">Dear Cifarx Hiring Team</h6>

            <!-- Cover Letter Contents -->
            <p class="text-justify" id="coverLetterContents">
                I am writing to express my keen interest in the PHP Backend Developer (Remote) position at Cifarx. With
                over two years of professional experience in backend development, particularly using PHP and the Laravel
                framework, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to your development team and deliver
                scalable, high-performance backend solutions. <br><br>

                Throughout my career, I have worked extensively on developing and maintaining robust APIs and backend
                services. I follow clean coding practices and always aim for maintainability, performance, and security.
                My work style is rooted in agile methodologies, and I am comfortable participating in sprint planning,
                daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. I thrive in collaborative environments and value clear, respectful
                communication with product managers, designers, and fellow engineers. <br><br>

                While PHP (Laravel) is my core strength, I also have a proactive mindset and am open to learning and
                working with Python when needed. My understanding of software design patterns, relational databases, and
                basic DevOps practices (like version control, and server configuration) equips me to be a
                well-rounded team contributor. <br><br>

                What excites me about Cifarx is your emphasis on growth, flexibility, and real collaboration. The
                opportunity to work remotely while staying connected to a forward-thinking team based in Bangladesh is
                exactly what I’m looking for. I am enthusiastic about bringing my experience, energy, and
                problem-solving skills to a team that values continuous learning and technological excellence. <br><br>

                Please find my resume attached for your review. I would be delighted to further discuss how I can
                support your backend development efforts and contribute to the success of Cifarx.
